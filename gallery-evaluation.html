                This self-evaluation essay provides me with an opportunity to assess the steps I have followed in
                accomplishing my tasks. It also allows me to reflect on the skills and techniques I have employed
                throughout the process, as well as the difficulties encountered while using the chosen tools and
                equipment to create the artwork. This evaluation will be instrumental in helping me identify my
                strengths and weaknesses, thereby understanding what and how to improve. </p>

                The first task assigned to me involved selecting a color scheme from a specific era and creating a
                collection of artworks. To begin, I conducted research on various art styles and color schemes from the
                mentioned eras, utilizing resources such as Pinterest and Google. This research led to the creation of a
                mood board using a selection of stock images to represent the chosen color scheme. Following this, I
                produced a variety of sketches, which later served as the foundation for the artwork's structure. These
                sketches were then organized into three distinct folders labeled ‘raster’, ‘vector’, and ‘not using’. In
                parallel, I compiled a database of stock images to assist in the creation of the artworks.

                <div class="col-7">
                    <p>Initially, I planned to create raster images using Affinity Photo and the XP Artist 13.3 Pro
                        graphic
                        tablet. However, this process proved to be quite tedious and unsatisfying, primarily due to the
                        low
                        quality of the output and the significant time consumption. Consequently, I switched to using
                        Procreate on the iPad for raster image creation. </p>
                </div>
                <p>This involved placing stock images onto the canvas,
                    editing them, and arranging them according to the chosen sketch. From these arranged images, I
                    created a second sketch. This second sketch was then lowered in opacity to facilitate the drawing of
                    clean, clear line art over it.</p>

                    Vector images were created using Affinity Designer, alongside the XP Artist 13.3 Pro graphic tablet.
                    The
                    process began with placing stock images onto the canvas. These images served as a reference for
                    creating
                    specific shapes using the pen tool, which were then utilized to closely replicate the structure of
                    the
                    chosen sketch. After establishing the main elements, the background was designed to complement the
                    overall composition. Special effects were then applied to enhance the visual appeal of the artwork.
                    Finally, the completed vector artwork was exported in the EPS format.

                    <figcaption style="background-color: #F430D7; padding: 0.2em;">The initial gallery sketch

                </figure>
                <p>The second task involved creating a gallery that complements the artworks I had previously created.
                    The
                    initial concept for the gallery was a carousel-like design. I started by sketching the wireframe by
                    hand
                    in KeepNotes, and then created a cleaner version in Figma. However, this carousel concept had to be
                    abandoned because Acrobat Reader no longer supports the 'object state' feature following the
                    retirement
                    of Flash. As a result, I redesigned the wireframes, this time in the form of a zine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gallery creation process initially utilized Adobe InDesign. However, upon completion and during
                    my
                    attempt to export it as an interactive PDF, I encountered a major issue: the chosen interactive
                    elements
                    were not functioning correctly. It appeared that these features might no longer be supported.
                    Consequently, I decided to abandon this approach. Working with InDesign proved to be a highly
                    challenging experience for me. I found the software to be tiresome, the learning curve steep, and
                    the
                    control mechanisms less intuitive compared to other applications I have used in the past.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>I later opted to use Affinity Publisher for the creation of the gallery. The process began
                            with
                            the design of the background, which featured a gradient embellished with stars. Following
                            this,
                            I created the title in an elliptical form to add to the visual appeal. After finalizing the
                            background and the title, these elements were exported as PNG files. Subsequently, the
                            artworks
                            were strategically placed along with these elements throughout the gallery.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-5">
                        <figure>

                            <figcaption style="background-color: #F430D7; padding: 0.2em;">The eplipse used for the

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Upon completion of
                    the gallery layout, I inserted hyperlinks onto the buttons. The final step was to export the
                    entire gallery as a PDF file.</p>
                <p class="my-4"><i>Personally, I found most of the tasks to be quite enjoyable, particularly the
                        creation of
                        the artwork. Reflecting on the completed project, I am very satisfied with the outcome of both
                        the
                        gallery and the artwork. It was a fulfilling experience, and I would be eager to undertake
                        similar
                        projects again if the opportunity presents itself.</i></p>
